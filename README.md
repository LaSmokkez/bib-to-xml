# bibxml
Turns a .bib reference list into a .xml reference list that can be used in Word.

Code relies on no dependencies. Also supports Journal Articles and Books, others are yet to be implemented (not hard, just takes some time).
Code might not be efficient, I made it because I needed it, and the tools online didn't work. Most definitely can be done better.
Not tested for any use cases other than my own, so might not work for you.

I am not a SWE, just doing it for fun.
